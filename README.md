# US-Airline-Delay-EDA
Hello my name is Priyanshu Raj, I have taken the dataset Airline Delay Cause Dataset from Kaggle which was collected form U.S. Department of Transportation's (DOT) Bureau of Transportation Statistics (BTS) for the year 2003 to 2022. The parameters were defined based on the delay and their cause of various airline in U.S. This dataset has 21 features and 318017 attributes which effect the data.
Let me explain some of the features.
About the Dataset :
This dataset is all about flights in the united states, including information about the number, length, and type of delays between 2003-2016. The data is reported for individual months at every major airport for every carrier.
The data comes from the U.S. Department of Transportation's (DOT) Bureau of Transportation Statistics (BTS)
The report is focusing on data from year 2002, estimated that air transportation delays put a 4 billion dollar dent in the country's gross domestic product that year.
Why this dataset?
In transport economics, the value of time is the opportunity cost of the time that a traveler spends on their journey. In essence, this makes it the amount that a traveler would be willing to pay in order to save time, or the amount they would accept as compensation for lost time.
Time is valuable thing therefore this caught my intrest in this dataset and I was curious behind knowing the delay and cause of various airline compny in US from year 2002 to 2022.
